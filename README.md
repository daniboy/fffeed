Facebook Friends Feed
=====================

Keep track of changes to your Facebook friends list.

No longer works
---------------

On April 4th, 2018, Facebook removed access to the API endpoints that were used
by this application to track your friends list, as a result of the Cambridge
Analytica scandal.

You may browse the code in previous commits, but it is unlikely to work
anymore.
